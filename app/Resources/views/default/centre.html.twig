            Eagle Canoe Centre is the based on the banks of the river Wensum, two kilometres from the centre of Norwich.

At New Mills Yard there is a short portage which allows access through the city, passing Cow Tower, Pulls Ferry, Norwich Cathedral and beyond towards Whitlingham and the Broads.
