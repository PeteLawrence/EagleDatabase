            The club has been grateful for funding support from a number of national grant bodies and from local employers. These have included grants from Sport England, regional trusts, the National Lottery Awards for All fund and Sport England Small Grants. These grants have helped to provide brand new facilities at Eagle Canoe Centre and allowed us to expand the range of opportunities provided through the club and at Eagle Canoe Centre.
