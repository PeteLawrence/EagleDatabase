        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Norwich Eagle Canoe Club has been in existence for over 50 years and in 1998 became affiliated to <a href="https://www.britishcanoeing.org.uk/" target="_blank">British Canoeing</a>, the national governing body for paddlesports. The club continues to grow, and the range of activities and events offered evolves annually following feedback from members and coaches.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2009 the club gained <a href="http://www.sportenglandclubmatters.com/club-mark/" target="_blank">Clubmark</a> accreditation and in 2013 was awarded Top Club accreditation, the only national cross-sports quality accreditation scheme for clubs with junior sections. The accreditation is built around a set of core criteria, which ensure that accredited clubs operate to a set of consistent, accepted and adopted operating standards.
