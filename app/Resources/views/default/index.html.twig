            We are a thriving paddlesport club based in Norwich, offering fantastic opportunities to learn canoeing and kayaking. We cater for all abilities, from complete beginners to accomplished paddlers and provide a safe, controlled environment with coaching being undertaken by qualified and experience paddlers talented coaches and an ever-expanding fleet of canoes and kayaks. Our focus is on recreational paddling, and the club has a great family atmosphere that keeps our members coming back year after year. The club caters for all age groups and encourages family membership, however we generally recommend that children should be aged 10 or over to ensure that they are strong enough to handle the canoes and kayaks.

            The club has been in existence for over 50 years and in 1998 we became affiliated to the British Canoe Union, the national governing body for paddlesports with club activities being undertaken in line with the BCUâ€™s guidelines. The club continues to grow and the range of activities and events offered evolves annually following feedback from members and Coaches and the range of club boats available to members continues to expand to reflect these opportunities.
