            Joining the club couldn’t be easier. Please email <a href="mailto:secretary@eaglecanoeclub.co.uk?subject=Membership" ga-on="click" ga-event-category="MailToLink" ga-event-action="secretary@eaglecanoeclub.co.uk?subject=Membership">secretary@eaglecanoeclub.co.uk</a> who can send you membership forms for you to print, fill in, sign and bring along with your membership fee on an enrolment night (the first Wednesday of the month April-September).
        </p>
        <p>
            New members enrol on the first Wednesday of the month throughout the spring and summer (April to September). We suggest that those looking to enrol arrive at about 7pm, as this gives us time to get existing members organised and on the water.
        </p>
        <p>
            Generally new members don’t paddle on the night of enrolment, but you can get afloat the following week. There will be an existing club members to show you round and tell you a bit more about how we operate on a club night so you can arrive ready to go the following week.
